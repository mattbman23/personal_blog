## Overview

This will be a guide on setting up portainer and traefik on a cloud ec2/compute instance. Afterwards, we will configure it to host containers and expose to the world.

## Prereqs

1. Any cloud provider account (I will be using Oracle as they provide a 4 vCPU, 24GB Mem, 500GB Storage for free)
2. A domain to access your containers

## Setting up a new compute instance (Skip if not using oracle cloud)

I will be using [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html) as they provide a compute instance for life (as of 2022).

**Warning:** Oracle cloud only provides free 4vCPU, 24GB Mem, 500GB Storage computation betweem all the instances.

Head to [Compute Instance](https://cloud.oracle.com/compute/instances) once login and click on the `Create Instance` button. You can leave almost everything to the default except the `Shape` section. Change the shape series to `Ampere`, select the `VM.Standard.A1.Flex (Always Free-Eligible)` and configure the OCPUs to 4 and memory to 24GB.

<div className="flex flex-wrap w-screen -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2 items-center">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    ![ShapeSetting](/static/images/computeShapeSetting.png)
  </div>
</div>

Make sure to download your `private` and `public` key, once done you can set the bool volume to 500GB to make full use of their free perks and then create the instance.

To ssh into your compute instance once it's up. You first need to change to permission of your private key by running the `sudo chmod 400 <your downloaded private key>`, then you can ssh into it by running the command `ssh opc@<your compute public ip address> -i <your downloaded private key>`.

Run the following command to update the system, `sudo dnf update -y`.

## Installing docker

Run the following commands in order to update the system and install docker

```sh
# Updates the system
sudo yum update -y

# Install the required deps
sudo yum install -y yum-utils

# Add docker repository to system
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

# Install docker
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y

# Enable and start docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Run docker as non-root
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo newgrp docker
```

You should be able to run `docker ps` without any issue after running the commands aboved.

## Install and configure portainer

Before we install and run portainer, we should first create a persistent volume by running `docker volume create portainer_data`. This will enable to rerun from the backup incase the container somehow crashes.

To run and start portianer just run `docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce.` This will run the portainer-ce image in the background named `portainer` with port 9000 exposed for access the UI. We also linked the container with both the created persistent volume and local docker so that portainer can manage docker for us.

#### Exposing Portainer

To access portainer from the cloud, we will need to expose port `9000` on both the system and network to the world. You can expose it from the system just by running `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp`.

To expose it over the network, under your compute instance dashboard. Click on your `subnet` under the `Primary VNIC` section. Afterwards click on your `Default Security List` under the Security Lists section.

<div className="flex flex-row -mx-2 overflow-hidden space-x-1 ">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2 border border-2">
    ![Maple](/static/images/portainerTraefik/aa.png)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2 border border-2">
    ![Lake](/static/images/portainerTraefik/ab.png)
  </div>
</div>

Under the `Ingress Rules` section, click the `Add Ingress Rules` button and expose port 9000 by inputing it in the Destination Port Range. An example is shown below.

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-screen overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-2/2">
  ![Mountains](/static/images/portainerTraefik/ac.png)
</div>

Once done, you can access it by typing your public ip address at port 9000 (`<your public ip address:9000`). You should be welcome to a portainer page asking to set your username and password.

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-screen overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-2/2">
  ![Mountains](/static/images/portainerTraefik/ad.png)
</div>

After setting up your portainer account, you should be shown the `Environment Wizard` page. You can click `Get Started` to finally use portainer!

## Configuring Traefik

First create a traefik folder in your `/etc` directory by running the command `sudo mkdir /etc/traefik`. Then create a `traefik.yml` file inside the newly create folder and copy the content shown below. The only thing that needs to be edited is the email part, change `youremail@gmail.com` to your email. This will associate your email with the certificate letsencrypt will provide you for https.

```yml
global:
  checkNewVersion: true
  sendAnonymousUsage: false

api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: true

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: :80
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: websecure
          scheme: https

  websecure:
    address: :443

certificatesResolvers:
  staging:
    acme:
      email: youremail@gmail.com
      storage: /etc/traefik/certs/acme.json
      caServer: 'https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web

  production:
    acme:
      email: youremail@gmail.com
      storage: /etc/traefik/certs/acme.json
      caServer: 'https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web

providers:
  docker:
    exposedByDefault: false # Default is true
  file:
    directory: /etc/traefik
    watch: true
```

After creating the traefik.yml file, you will need to create a directory at `/etc/traefik/certs`. That will be the location where you certs from letsencrypt be placed. You can make the directory by running the following commands.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/traefik/certs
```

## Using up traefik

Login to your portianer.io dashboard and go into Stacks. Click the blue `Add stack` button and just name traefik or whatever name you want. Then paste the yml file from below into the web editor and then you can finally deploy the stack.

```yml
version: '3'

volumes:
  traefik-ssl-certs:
    driver: local

services:
  traefik:
    image: 'traefik:v2.5'
    container_name: 'traefik'
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      - /etc/traefik:/etc/traefik
      - traefik-ssl-certs:/ssl-certs
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
```

### Using Traefik

To use traefik with your containers, you will only need to update the labels when creating deploying it on portianer. Let's say you want to deploy a react app that is listening on port 3000, you will put in the image name and required environment variables like usually. Afterwards, you will add in custom traefik labels as shown below.
`layout` is mapped to wrapper which wraps the entire MDX content.

```sh
traefik.enable: true
traefik.http.routers.index.entrypoints: web, websecure
traefik.http.routers.index.rule: Host(`<your-url-that-you-want-to-link-to`)
traefik.http.routers.index.tls: true
traefik.http.routers.index.tls.certresolver: production     # put staging if you want to test
traefik.http.services.index.loadbalancer.server.port: 3000  # port to your app
```

Once done and running, you can visit your url that you link the container to. It will take a while for the https to take effect.
